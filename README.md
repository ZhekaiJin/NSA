# NSA

Me playing with around React.js and front end; I designed a dashboard using React, D3 and Ant Design backed by API from stats.nba.com to visualize any individual playerâ€™s shot data, including a shot chart and user profile view. Just like this:

![curry](imgs/curry.png)

The implementation invovles creating a few extra filters and 2 shot themes(hexbin and scatter) to provide the more customized visualization you see on the shotchart. The autocomplete player search bar added below providing a list of players(image and name) in the suggestion list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Just get [npm and Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), then

```
git clone https://github.com/ZhekaiJin/NSA.git
npm install
```
wait with your patience for all packages to be installed 

### Installing
In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Build

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
